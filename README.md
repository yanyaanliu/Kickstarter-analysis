# Module-1-Challenge-Kickstarting-with-Excel
Up-and-coming playwright, Louise, has launched her first fundraising campaign for her play *Fever*. In a very short amount of time, *Fever* came close to its fundraising goal. The purpose of this project is to discover how launch dates and funding goals impact different campaigns.  The analysis was performed on the Kickstarting dataset which contains fundraising goals, launch dates, outcomes, etc.  Utilizing pivot tables,  functions, formulas and charts, we are able to visualize campaign outcomes and their relationship with launch dates and funding goals.
